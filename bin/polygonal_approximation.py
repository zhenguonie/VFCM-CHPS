This file contains the implementation of polygonal approximation through
dominant point detection.

The goal of this algorithm is to reduce the set of points needed to define a
polygon to as small as possible of a set that still accurately characterizes the
shape. This is done by only considering the dominant points along the closed
polyline that defines that polygon.

This implementation is based on the paper "A Computer Vision Framework for
Detecting Dominant Points on Contour of Image-Object Through Thick-Edge
Polygonal Approximation" by Saha, et al.
